This project aims at detecting Parkinsons thorugh machine learning some real data. 
We have used the UCI ML Parkinsons dataset, available at: 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/parkinsons

After elimination of many redundant features by principal component analysis,
a best accuracy > 97% on the test set is achieved by Support Vector classifier among 
several competing models that are hyperparameter-tuned and trained.
